# Convective Heat Transfer Around a Confined Cylinder
OpenFOAM case setups and post-processing scripts used in the
Master’s project on confined cylinder heat transfer at AAU.


## Software versions
The cases were developed and tested using:
- OpenFOAM v2112 
- Python 3

Other recent OpenFOAM and Python 3.x versions may also work

## Cases
This repository contains two OpenFOAM case setups:

- Base_Unsteady_Laminar/Medium_mesh_40000  
- Base_Unsteady_Turbulent/Mesh_180000_test
- Turbulent_3D

Only the case definitions are included (0/, constant/, system/ + helper scripts).
Simulation results (time directories, processor* folders, postProcessing, logs) are excluded.

## Run case (example)
```bash
cd Base_Unsteady_Turbulent/Mesh_180000_test
./Allrun

If using Visual Studio Code, one can also find the case in the file-tree, right-click on a case and select "Open in Integrated Terminal" and from there write ./Allrun and press ENTER. 

## Post-processing
The repository includes Python scripts for analysing simulation output:
- Data_Processing.py (Nu vs time plot, velocity profiles plot, a summary)
- plotResiduals.py (plots the residuals, not that foamLog + solver-log needs to be run first)
- plot_yplus_summary (only for turbulent cases)

These scripts operate on OpenFOAM output generated during the simulations and may be executed while a simulation is running in another terminal.

## Run python script (example)
```bash
cd Base_Unsteady_Turbulent/Mesh_180000_test
python3 Data_Processing.py
